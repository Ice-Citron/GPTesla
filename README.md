This is my leading up research and initiative for my IB DP CS EE. On creating a transformer. I am following O'reilly's NLP book for guidance to create this transformer, which should be a &lt;100 million parameter model, that generates Python code based on prompt simillar to GitHub co-pilot. Resource used for now is 4x Nvidia A100 80GB from Nvidia.
